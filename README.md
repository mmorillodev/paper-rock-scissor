## - About the app

**Rock paper scissors** (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone", roshambo or ro-sham-bo)[1][2][3] is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.

A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. The type of game originated in China and spread with increased contact with East Asia, while developing different variants in signs over time.


## - How to use this app

### **Setting up the server**
 - First of all you will need to run this application as a server that will play a role of a dedicated server. Once you see the message in the console indicating that the server is ready for use, you are able to share the IP address, also shown in the console, with your friends!

### **As a client**
 - As a client you will be able to create an party or join an existing one. A game party is a gaming room that you can share with your friend, and other players can also create one not disturbing your game play! This way, the server can serve lots of players and provide lots of game play simultaneously.
 - Whether you choose to create an party, you will only have to choose a name for that party. In the other hand, if you choose to connect to an existing party, you'll have to provide the name of the party you wanna connect to, or type _!list_ to get the full list of available parties.
